An easy to understand and quite quickly hacked Spring boot project, registers devices and sends
FCM messages (very simple ones) to registered devices by using a GET endpoint (should be POST really).

To start it up, provide your FCM server key (e.g. by using --serverKey=YOUR_KEY).
Then register your device with a get call. Don't forget to activate Messaging for your APP.
